OpenAgendaMail 1.8
==================

What is OpenAgendaMail?

Generating an agenda document is a very automate-able task.  Tasks that can be automated should be in order to reduce errors and save time for human beings to do fun stuff, like going to the movies or flying a kite.

OpenAgendaMail utilizes email, a technology that everyone is familiar with to accomplish its work.  Your users don't need to learn to use a new tool or install any unfamiliar software.  All they need is an email account.

When its time, OpenAgendaMail generates a .pdf document, which is easily read by Macs, Linux boxes and Windows-based PCs of the agenda items your users have submitted and emails it out to the list of users.  Only submissions from the email accounts on your email list will be added to the document so no unexpected items will appear on your agenda.


What are the system requirements?

OpenAgendaMail will run on any Windows, Linux or Mac OS PC that has the Java 7 JRE available.  

OpenAgendaMail requires a gmail account.  Do not use an email account that you use for any other purpose as OpenAgendaMail will delete emails from the account without asking permission offering to replace them or buying you a soda to cheer you up afterwards.
