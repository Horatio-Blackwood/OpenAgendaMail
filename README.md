OpenAgendaMail
==============

OpenAgendaMail is an email-based agenda aggregation program for your group. Members can simply send a quick email to add an item to an agenda. On the appropriate day the application organizes each of the submitted agenda items, generates a .docx file and emails it out to a configurable list of email addresses.
